# Udacity 'Explore and Analyze a Dataset' Project
## White Wine Quality Analysis

### Objective:
  The aim of this project is to apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies. __R__ programming and specifically __dplyr__, __tidyr__, __ggplot__ libraries are widely used.


### Dataset:
  The tidy data set contains 4,898 white wines with 11 variables on quantifying the chemical properties of each wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).

### Analyses
  The main consideration was to explore the features which makes a wine high-quality. The relationships between features and quality were investigated in detail. Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate exploratory analyses were conducted. Histograms, Scatter plots, Line Graphs, Box Plots, and Smoothing curves were used for the visualization and analyses.
